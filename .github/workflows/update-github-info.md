# Update Mona's GitHub Info website

Read `notes/mona-notes.md` before making changes.

Use these sources:
- `notes/mona-notes.md`
- GitHub Blog: https://github.blog/latest/
- GitHub Changelog: https://github.blog/changelog/
- Awesome Copilot workflows: https://awesome-copilot.github.com/workflows/

Fetch the Awesome Copilot workflows catalog with `web-fetch`:
https://awesome-copilot.github.com/workflows/

Read external public guidance with `web-fetch`, and read repository guidance or reference files with GitHub repository API tools instead of terminal, CLI, or sandboxed commands.

Update `site/content/github-info.md` with short, practical updates for developers and include source context whenever the content comes from the GitHub Blog or GitHub Changelog.

Open a pull request for Mona to review using `safe-outputs` and `create-pull-request`. Do not write directly to `main`; propose the update via a pull request so Mona can review it before publishing.
